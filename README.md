# Weather App

# Setup Installation

    - Clone the Github repository and run npm install to be to run it in your local.
    - I have used Shadcn component UI library so you have to install shadcn as well.
    - Go to the Shadcn website and to the installation docs then follow them step by step.
    - Create a free openweather acoount for free API Key
    - Replace the API key in the .env file with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap.
    - If key inside .env file does not work then create a file for api-key and import it into the main page.tsx file and then use it.
